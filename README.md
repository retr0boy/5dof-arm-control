# 5dof-arm-control
ROBT403 Lab 4 

This repo contains src folder of my workspace and can work with 5dof planar 'snake' robot. aiweru_arm is configured moveit package that controls the robot. dynamixel_motor is clone of same named repo, but it is partly refactored in python 3 to be able to work in ROS Noetic on WSL2. snake-noetic is clone of same named repo, used as framework to work with rviz and etc.
